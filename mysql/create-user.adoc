==== Creating a user

Creating new MySQL users will be common in this guide. We need to create the
database for the user, then create the user and assign it permissions on that
database only.


[source,sql]
----
CREATE DATABASE database_name;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON database_name.* TO 'user_name'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
----

Replace database_name, user_name and password with your own values. `password`
can be generated with `openssl rand -hex 31`.
